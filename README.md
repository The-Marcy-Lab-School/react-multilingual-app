# State

## Set Up
It's highly recommended you use the scaffolding tool [Create React App](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) to create your starter code. 
1. Run the command `npx create-react-app <name-of-your-app>`. 
2. `cd` into your newly created project.
3. Run `npm start`.

## Code Challenge

You will make a `MultiLingualGreeting` component:
* It should render as a greeting (perhaps, "Good Morning") in English. 
* Beneath this greeting, there should be five buttons. 
* Each button should correspond to a different language (perhaps, "Spanish", "Haitian Creole", and "Portuguese"). 
* When a button is clicked, the greeting above should be translated to the appropriate language.
* **Hint**: Your component will need to have state. Then, when a button is clicked, the state should change depending on which button was clicked. Finally, the greeting that is shown on the page should change depending on the state.
