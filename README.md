# Multilingual Lab

You will be building out the following project. You should divide your UI into the appropriate components and should utilize state and the `useState` hook. 

## Demo of App

![demo](./demo.gif)

## Features

* Your app should render as a greeting (perhaps, "Good Morning") in English. 
* Beneath this greeting, there should be five buttons. 
* Each button should correspond to a different language (perhaps, "Spanish", "Haitian Creole", and "Portuguese"). 
* When a language button is clicked, the greeting above should be translated to the appropriate language.
* Above your greeting, there should be two buttons to change the font size.
* When the buttons are clicked, the greeting size should grow or shrink accordingly. 
* Your greeting should be its own component. In addition, each set of buttons should be their own component. 

## Set Up
It's highly recommended you use the scaffolding tool [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) to create your starter code. You can run these commands to get started:

```sh
# Check your npm version
npm -v 

# npm 6.x
npm create vite@latest project-name --template react

# npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed:
npm create vite@latest project-name -- --template react

cd project-name
npm i
npm run dev
```
